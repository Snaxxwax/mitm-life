# Network Scanner Suite v2.0

The Network Scanner Suite is a comprehensive Python-based tool designed for security professionals conducting authorized penetration tests and network assessments. This latest version introduces advanced stealth capabilities, enhanced reporting, and improved performance for large-scale network discovery.

## Features

### Core Scanning Capabilities

- **Port Scanning**: TCP/UDP port discovery with customizable timing
- **Service Detection**: Advanced service fingerprinting and version detection
- **OS Fingerprinting**: Operating system identification using TCP/IP stack analysis
- **Stealth Modes**: Multiple evasion techniques to avoid detection

### Advanced Features

- **Distributed Scanning**: Coordinate scans across multiple hosts
- **Custom Payloads**: Extensible payload system for specialized testing
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Live scan progress with detailed statistics
- **Export Formats**: JSON, XML, CSV, and HTML reporting

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/mitmlife/network-scanner-suite.git
cd network-scanner-suite

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run setup
python setup.py install
```

## Basic Usage

### Quick Network Scan

```bash
# Basic network discovery
python scanner.py -t 192.168.1.0/24 -p 1-1000

# Stealth scan with timing controls
python scanner.py -t target.com -sS -T2 --randomize-hosts
```

### Advanced Scanning

```bash
# Comprehensive scan with service detection
python scanner.py -t 10.0.0.0/16 -sV -O -A --max-rate 1000

# Custom port ranges and protocols
python scanner.py -t targets.txt -p 22,80,443,8080-8090 -sU -sT
```

## Configuration

The scanner supports extensive configuration through both command-line arguments and configuration files:

```yaml
# config.yaml
scan_settings:
  default_timing: T3
  max_concurrent: 100
  timeout: 30

stealth_options:
  fragment_packets: true
  decoy_hosts: ['192.168.1.100', '192.168.1.101']
  source_port: 53

reporting:
  format: json
  include_screenshots: false
  detailed_services: true
```

## Security Considerations

This tool is designed exclusively for authorized security testing. Users must ensure they have explicit permission to scan target networks. Unauthorized network scanning may violate local laws and organizational policies.

### Legal Usage Guidelines

- Obtain written authorization before scanning
- Respect rate limits and avoid disrupting services
- Follow responsible disclosure practices
- Document all testing activities

## Technical Details

The Network Scanner Suite leverages several advanced techniques:

### Packet Crafting

Custom packet construction allows for precise control over scan characteristics, enabling evasion of common detection mechanisms while maintaining scan accuracy.

### Threading Architecture

Multi-threaded design with intelligent work distribution ensures optimal performance across different network conditions and target types.

### Detection Evasion

Multiple stealth techniques including packet fragmentation, timing randomization, and decoy host injection help avoid detection by intrusion detection systems.
