## üìå Project Overview
| Field | Value |
|------|-------|
| **Project Name** | **MITM.life - Cybersecurity Blog** |
| **Goal** | A modern cybersecurity blog focused on security research, tools, and analysis with content management via Obsidian |
| **Stack** | Frontend: **Astro** ¬∑ Hosting: **Cloudflare Pages** ¬∑ CI: **GitHub Actions** |
| **Agents & Tools** | Agent: **Claude Code** (context window: **7**) ¬∑ Tools: **Playwright**, **filesystem**, **git hooks** |

## üóÇÔ∏è Architecture & Structure
| Category | Choice |
|----------|--------|
| **Folder Layout** | `/src`, `/public`, `/src/pages`, `/src/components`, `/src/layouts`, `/tests/e2e`, `/docs`, `/obsidian-vault` |
| **Frontend Framework** | Astro with React integration for interactive components |
| **Server/Edge** | Cloudflare Pages (with content loaded from Obsidian vault) |
| **Styling** | TailwindCSS with shadcn/ui components and dark theme |
| **Testing** | Playwright (E2E), Vitest (unit tests), accessibility testing with @axe-core/playwright |
| **Other Libraries** | astro-loader-obsidian, ESLint, Prettier, Husky, lint-staged, TypeScript |

---

## üß© Agents, Hooks, and Tools
| Topic | Configuration |
|------|----------------|
| **Agent** | Use **Claude Code Agent** with **context=7**. Summarize long diffs into memory snippets when exceeding context. Prefer file-scoped edits via filesystem tool. |
| **Filesystem Tool** | Allowed to read/write within repo. All generated files must be idempotent and formatted. Never overwrite `.env` without explicit confirmation. |
| **Playwright** | `tests/e2e` directory; run in CI and locally; record traces on failure. |
| **Git Hooks** | Husky pre-commit runs lint/format + Playwright smoke test. |
| **Commit Style** | Conventional Commits. Agent generates commit messages & updates this memory file. |
